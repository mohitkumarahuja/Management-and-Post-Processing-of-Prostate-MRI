# Management-and-Post-Processing-of-Prostate-MRI
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate appears in older men. About 85% of cases are diagnosed in men over 60 years. Prostate cancer is a common cancer who’s the incidence and mortality are now steadily increasing (85,000 new cases per year in Europe) [1]. It is the second most common cancer after lung cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in men (9% of all cancer deaths in men in Europe).

Currently, there are four anatomically glandular areas within the prostate: 
- Peripheral zone (ZP) 
- Central zone (ZC) 
- Transition zone (ZT) 
- Anterior Fibromuscular Tissue (AFT)

#Diagnostic: 

The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides high-resolution images in all planes of space, allowing precise anatomical visualization of the prostate. MRI of prostate cancer benefits from technological advances that expand more indications. MRI is a valuable tool to guide therapeutic management of prostate cancer through acquisition sequences[2] as follows: 

• Anatomical imaging– 3D - T2 weighted imaging 
• Diffusion imaging – ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) 
• Perfusion imaging –DCE (Dynamic Contrast Enhancement) (Observation from signal-intensity time curve) 
• Spectroscopy
